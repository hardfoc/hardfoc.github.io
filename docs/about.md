# About This Documentation

The `docs/` directory holds all Markdown files that become the published site.
Each sub-folder provides a page on the site, for example:

```
docs/
  getting-started/
  api/
  porting/
  hardware/
```

`mkdocs.yml` at the repository root describes the navigation and theme.
