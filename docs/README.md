# Documentation

This folder contains the Markdown sources that are turned into the public website.

```
docs/
  getting-started/
  api/
  porting/
  hardware/
```

Each sub-folder has its own `README.md` which becomes a page on the site. The
MkDocs configuration lives in the repository root as `mkdocs.yml`.
